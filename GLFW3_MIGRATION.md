# DOOM.rb Renderer Documentation

## Overview
Documentation for DOOM.rb's software renderer implementation, covering the migration from OpenGL to pure GLFW3 and ongoing development.

## Core Requirements
- Use only GLFW3 gem for window management
- Implement software rendering with pixel buffers
- No OpenGL dependencies
- No FFI on GLFW
- Hard lock to 800x600 resolution
- Follow software rendering techniques for all graphics

## Migration Status

### Core Requirements (Partially Met)
- ✓ Using only glfw3 gem for window management
- ✓ No OpenGL dependencies removed
- ✓ No FFI usage on GLFW
- ✓ Hard locked to 800x600 resolution
- ⚠️ Software rendering implementation incomplete (pixel buffer update method not working)

### Completed Changes
1. **Dependencies Cleaned Up** ✓
   - Removed OpenGL-related code
   - Cleaned up Gemfile (only glfw3 remains)
   - Removed shader_manager.rb and geometry_manager.rb
   - Removed chunky_png gem

2. **Window Management** ✓
   - Clean GLFW3 window lifecycle
   - Proper event polling and input handling
   - Signal handlers for graceful cleanup
   - Window hints configured for software rendering

3. **Base Renderer Structure** (Partial)
   - ✓ Basic pixel buffer infrastructure
   - ✓ Frame timing system (target: 30 FPS)
   - ✓ Optimized buffer operations
   - ⚠️ Pixel buffer to window transfer not working
   - ⚠️ No texture system yet

### Current Blockers
1. **Software Rendering**
   - Need correct GLFW3 method for updating window pixels
   - Current `set_pixels` method doesn't exist
   - Need to implement proper buffer transfer mechanism

2. **Performance**
   - Current FPS: Not measurable (rendering not working)
   - Target FPS: 30+
   - Need efficient pixel buffer updates
   - Frame buffer synchronization pending

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Priority**
   - Fix pixel buffer to window transfer
   - Implement proper GLFW3 software rendering method
   - Get basic wall rendering working

2. **Following Tasks**
   - Implement texture system
   - Add floor/ceiling rendering
   - Add sprite system
   - Optimize rendering performance

### Testing Requirements
- Run rake test for non-rendering components
- Use freedoom1.wad for testing
- Manual renderer testing with rake doom
- Document observations in WORKLOGS.md

### Resources
- GLFW3 gem documentation
- Original DOOM source code
- Software rendering techniques

   - Parse ANIMATED lump
   - Handle wall switches
2. Performance tuning
3. Memory optimization
4. Bug fixes and stability

## Software Rendering Investigation

### Current Approach
1. **GLFW3 Capabilities**
   - GLFW3 gem provides basic window management 
   - No direct pixel buffer access method available 
   - Need alternative approach for software rendering

2. **Current Implementation Status**
   - Window Management:
     Basic window creation and lifecycle
     Event polling and input handling
     Clean separation in WindowManager class
     No OpenGL dependencies

   - Rendering Pipeline:
     Pixel buffer implementation needs revision
     Buffer to screen transfer not working
     Frame timing system in place
     Basic wall rendering logic ready

3. **Technical Constraints**
   - GLFW3 gem lacks direct framebuffer access
   - Need to investigate alternative buffer update methods
   - Must maintain pure software rendering approach
   - Cannot rely on OpenGL or hardware acceleration

### Revised Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term Solutions**
   - Keep window management minimal
   - Focus on basic functionality first
   - Maintain window responsiveness
   - Document limitations in WORKLOGS.md

2. **Investigation Needed**
   - Research GLFW3 buffer access methods
   - Study other software rendering approaches
   - Consider alternative pixel transfer methods
   - Document findings for future reference

3. **Next Steps**
   - Implement basic rendering proof of concept
   - Test different buffer update approaches
   - Focus on getting minimal wall rendering working
   - Document performance characteristics

### Current Priorities

1. **Critical Path**
   - Get basic window display working
   - Implement minimal wall rendering
   - Focus on stability over performance
   - Document all findings

2. **Deferred Tasks**
   - Advanced texture mapping
   - Performance optimizations
   - Visual effects
   - Non-essential features

### Testing Strategy

1. **Immediate Testing**
   - Basic window creation and management
   - Input handling and event processing
   - Simple shape rendering
   - Frame timing verification

2. **Documentation**
   - Update WORKLOGS.md with findings
   - Document technical limitations
   - Track performance metrics
   - Record implementation decisions

## Testing Strategy
- Visual inspection of rendering
- Performance monitoring and benchmarks
- Input response verification
- Memory usage tracking
- Unit tests for core components
- Memory leak detection
- State validation
