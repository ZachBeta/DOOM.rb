# FreeDOOM Manual PDF Workflow

This document describes how we extracted and processed the FreeDOOM manual for feature reference.

## Manual Acquisition

1. Downloaded the official FreeDOOM manual from:
   - Source: https://freedoom.github.io/freedoom-manual-en.pdf
   - Location: `docs/freedoom-manual-en.pdf`
   - Size: 1.3MB

## Text Extraction Process

1. Installed required tools:
   ```bash
   brew install poppler  # Provides pdftotext utility
   ```

2. Converted PDF to text:
   ```bash
   pdftotext docs/freedoom-manual-en.pdf docs/freedoom-manual-en.txt
   ```

## Feature Extraction

Based on the manual contents, we created:
- `FEATURES.md`: Comprehensive feature list organized by system
- Implementation phases from foundation to polish
- Technical requirements and performance targets

## Files Generated
- `docs/freedoom-manual-en.pdf`: Original manual
- `docs/freedoom-manual-en.txt`: Extracted text content
- `FEATURES.md`: Feature implementation roadmap

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Foundation Phase features
2. Reference manual text file for detailed mechanics
3. Update feature list as needed during development
