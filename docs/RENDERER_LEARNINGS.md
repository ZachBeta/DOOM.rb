# DOOM.rb Renderer Rebuild Learnings

## Overview
This document captures the key learnings and insights from our renderer rebuild attempt, which aimed to create a more robust and performant rendering system inspired by Chocolate DOOM's architecture.

## Key Learnings

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - OpenGL state tracking proved more complex than anticipated
   - Need for explicit state validation at key points
   - Importance of state transition logging for debugging

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Texture mapping performance critical for frame rate
   - Memory management for textures needs careful consideration
   - Wall segment merging essential for reducing draw calls

3. **Memory Management**
   - Texture streaming and caching crucial for performance
   - Need for efficient texture pooling system
   - Importance of texture compression for large WAD files

### Technical Insights

1. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - Clear separation between geometry and texture processing needed
   - Importance of efficient clipping algorithms
   - Need for better sprite sorting and management

2. **Resource Management**
   - WAD file texture extraction needs optimization
   - Texture palette management complexity
   - Memory budgeting crucial for stable performance

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Original targets:
     - 800x600 resolution
     - 35 FPS target
     - <100MB memory usage
   - Frame time budget distribution needs revision
   - Texture memory management needs refinement

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Architecture**
   - Consider implementing a command buffer system
   - Add better error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement more robust state validation

2. **Performance**
   - Implement sector-based visibility determination
   - Add view frustum culling
   - Optimize texture coordinate calculation

3. **Memory Management**
   - Implement smarter texture streaming
   - Add better texture cache management
   - Implement texture atlas system

### Testing Strategy

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Need for automated performance benchmarks
   - Better profiling tools integration
   - Systematic testing across different WAD files

2. **Validation**
   - Need for visual regression testing
   - State validation framework
   - Memory leak detection
