## Texture Rendering Optimizations

### Current Approach

1. **Texture Loading**
   - Textures are loaded from WAD file using `TextureComposer`
   - Patches are combined to form complete textures
   - Textures are stored in memory as indexed color data

2. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - Ray casting to find wall intersections
   - Wall slice height calculation based on distance
   - Texture coordinate calculation using wall hit position
   - Color batching to reduce draw calls
   - Distance-based fog effect

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Color caching to avoid recreating Gosu::Color objects
   - Line batching (up to 1000 lines) to reduce draw calls
   - View distance culling (MAX_DISTANCE = 20.0)
   - Height clamping to prevent extreme scaling
   - Texture coordinate clamping to prevent out-of-bounds access

### Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - FPS still lower than desired
   - Many draw calls despite batching
   - Texture sampling could be more efficient

2. **Visual Quality**
   - Texture mapping shows some artifacts
   - Texture scaling could be improved
   - Wall shading needs refinement

### Future Improvements

1. **Performance**
   - Implement texture mip-mapping
   - Further optimize texture sampling
   - Consider hardware acceleration options
   - Investigate texture atlas approach

2. **Visual Quality**
   - Improve texture coordinate calculation
   - Add proper perspective correction
   - Implement better texture filtering
   - Enhance lighting and shading

3. **Architecture**
   - Consider separating rendering logic
   - Add texture caching layer
   - Implement proper texture management
   - Add profiling tools
