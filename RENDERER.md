## Key Technical Decisions
- Use GLFW3's window as the primary display surface
- Implement software rendering instead of hardware acceleration
- Use direct pixel manipulation for all rendering
- Keep the 800x600 resolution lock
- Maintain separation between game logic and rendering
- Use GLFW's time functions for consistent frame timing

## Implementation Notes
- All rendering will be done through software-based techniques
- No external graphics libraries beyond GLFW3
- Focus on efficient pixel buffer manipulation
- Use GLFW3's built-in timing and input handling
- Maintain clean separation between game logic and rendering
- Follow original DOOM's rendering techniques where applicable
