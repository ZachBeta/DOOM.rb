    - wad:textures rake task
    - Texture composition testing

## Current Tasks

- [ ] stop outputting wad parse with puts in test env, instead log it
- [ ] fix puts vs logs in wad parser so it stops adding noise to output in terminal window, and instead uses logs for feedback
- [ ] continue upgrading logging system and log rotation, rotate logs as a requirement for every rake task

- [x] Complete TEXTURE1/TEXTURE2 parsing
  - [x] Implement texture composition from patches
  - [x] Handle texture name directory from PNAMES
  - [x] Integrate texture system with renderer
  - [x] Add texture caching for performance
  - [x] Support texture scaling and alignment
  - [x] Acceptance test: using freedoom textures when running `rake doom`

- [ ] Parse Level Geometry
  - VERTEXES lump parsing
  - LINEDEFS lump parsing
  - SIDEDEFS lump parsing
  - SECTORS lump parsing
  - BSP tree (NODES/SEGS/SSECTORS) parsing

- [ ] Implement Texture Animation
  - Parse ANIMATED lump
  - Handle wall switches (SWITCHES lump)
  - Support animated flats
  - Support animated walls

- [ ] Sprite System
  - Parse sprite name patterns
  - Handle rotation frames
  - Support different states
  - Implement transparency

- [ ] Sound System Integration
  - Parse DMXGUS lump
  - Handle sound effects
  - Support music lumps
  - Implement sound triggers
