  - Implemented basic logging system
  - Improved test design using real test objects
  - Added window closing with cmd+w and esc

- [x] Logging Improvements
  - Moved verbose logging to separate file
  - Implemented log levels for better cursor context
  - Added log rotation to prevent large files
  - Updated logging across game components
  
- [x] Performance & Display
  - Show frame rate (FPS) in top left display

## In Progress
