  - Player movement with wall sliding
  - Collision detection
  - Noclip mode (N key)
  - Minimap with player position/direction
  - FPS display

- [x] Texture System
  - WAD file parsing (header, directory, lumps)
  - Texture composition from patches
  - Texture caching and scaling
  - Support for TEXTURE1/TEXTURE2
  - Integration with renderer
  - Debug tools (wad:info, wad:textures)

- [x] Logging System
  - Multi-level logging (debug, verbose, game, doom)
  - Log rotation
  - Test environment optimization
  - Rake task for log management

- [x] Documentation
  - Consolidated renderer documentation in RENDERER.md
  - WAD format documentation
  - Project guidelines in RULES.md

# TODO

* try to render the wad maps with no textures
* is DebugLogger moot? can we make it more prominent if it's actually useful? maybe combine into the existing logger
