## Test-Driven Development Approach

### Test Categories
- Unit Tests: Individual component behavior
- Integration Tests: Component interactions
- Performance Tests: Frame rate and memory usage
- Visual Regression Tests: Screenshot comparisons

### Test Data Sets
- Minimal test maps (1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
- Standard DOOM maps (E1M1, E1M2)
- Edge cases (extreme angles, heights, distances)
- Performance stress tests (complex scenes)
